# Flipkart_Research_and_Product_Dissection_SQLProject

## 🛒 Flipkart Product Dissection Project
This project is a deep-dive analysis of Flipkart, one of India’s largest e-commerce platforms, aimed at understanding its business model, platform structure, and data flow. It is a part of a broader initiative to bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world product understanding and data handling. The project includes in-depth research, real-world case studies, platform analysis, and a proposed database schema modeled using SQL concepts.

## 📚 Research & Case Study
To set the stage, I conducted extensive research on the Indian e-commerce landscape, Flipkart's company profile, SWOT analysis, business model canvas, revenue streams, promotional strategies, and social initiatives. I also studied real case studies showcasing how Flipkart has innovatively solved user problems and improved customer satisfaction over the years. These research insights helped contextualize the technical and strategic aspects of the platform.

## 🔍 Product Dissection & Feature Analysis
The core of the project revolves around breaking down the Flipkart platform into its fundamental components. I identified key features that define user experience, such as personalized recommendations, cart systems, order tracking, and seller-side functionalities. I also highlighted areas for potential improvement and proposed feature enhancements based on observed gaps and market expectations.

## 🧩 Database Schema & SQL Design
To simulate a real-world backend structure, I designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that captures Flipkart’s essential entities like Users, Products, Orders, Sellers, Reviews, and Payments. This schema was developed with normalization principles and practical use cases in mind. The resulting SQL structure demonstrates how such a system might manage its data at scale, enabling robust querying and data retrieval for analytics and operations.
